Please note that this project is no longer actively maintained, and many of the dependencies are far out of date, specifically around SignalR.

WebRTC & SignalR Video Chat
=================

A demo project for playing around with Peer-to-Peer audio/video connections using WebRTC.  Signaling and management of users and active connections is handled by SignalR.

At the time of writing this, the application is working in the following browser releases:

- [Google Chrome Beta](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/beta.html) (26.0.1410.3)
- [Firefox Nightly](http://nightly.mozilla.org/) (21.0a1)

However, the WebRTC implementation is progressing in both browsers, so this may or may not be broken by the time you try to use it :)
